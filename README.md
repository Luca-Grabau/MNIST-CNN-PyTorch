# MNIST CNN Classifier in PyTorch

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Features
- Uses both basic and augmented transformations for preparing the dataset.
- Implements a custom CNN architecture with batch normalization and dropout for regularization.
- Provides a mechanism to load pre-trained model weights.
- Integrates TensorBoard for monitoring training progress.
- Visualizes convolutional layer weights and displays the model's training loss over time.
- Calculates and presents evaluation metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score on the test dataset.
- Displays a confusion matrix and per-class accuracy for deeper insights into the model's performance.

## Usage
1. Ensure all the necessary libraries like PyTorch, torchvision, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, and torchviz are installed.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Run the provided code/script.
